# Instagram Saver


 - install packages in both server and client folders
 - put the `service_account.json` from the email into the `server` folder :)
 - now you can run `yarn dev` inside `server`. it should start a server on `1337`
 - To see the UI and start using the app, goto the `client` folder and do `yarn start`. The browser should open up on 3000
 - Hope it works for you! 


Here's a log of how I was struck by disaster and finally got over:
 - 6th Oct: got a link to the assignment
 - 8th Oct: Finally found time in the night to do it.
 - 9th Oct: Son's 1st birthday!
 - 10th Oct: Setup the boilerplate with
    1. Express,
    2. Cypress,
    3. Wrote tests (only its),
    4. Typescript,
    5. CRA
    6. Tailwind
    7. Craco
 - Wrote some code to see if everything is working
 - Failed misreably because of [this horrible bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/7959). (It's filed in Next but it's an issue with craco.. and [tailwind needs craco to work with typescript](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app#install-and-configure-craco))
 - Decided to redo the whole thing. 
 - 11th October: Started in the evening. Finished in the night.

Sorry for the late submission!
I usually write tests with length commit messages. 
but I ran out of time. :\
